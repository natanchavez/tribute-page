			<!--  Biography  -->

				<p><b>Who was Alan Turing?</b></p>
				<p>
					Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 to 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician,
					logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a
					formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be
					considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of
					theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the Second World War, he worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at
					Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking center that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led
					Hut 8, the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of
					techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish
					bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing
					played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the
					Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win
					the war. Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on
					the length of the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war
					in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b>Some of Alan Turing quotes:</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<q>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.</q>
				</p>
				<p>
					<q>Those who can imagine anything, can create the impossible.</q>
				</p>
				<p>
					<q>The isolated man does not develop any intellectual power. It is necessary for him to be immersed
					   in an environment of other men, whose techniques he absorbs during the first twenty years of his
					   life. He may then perhaps do a little research of his own and make a very few discoveries which
					   are passed on to other men. From this point of view the search for new techniques must be
					   regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather than by individuals.</q>
